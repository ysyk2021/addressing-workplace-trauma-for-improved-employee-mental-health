The purpose of this book is to provide organizations with strategies for addressing workplace trauma and improving employee mental health. Trauma in the workplace can have a significant impact on employee well-being, organizational culture, and performance. By addressing trauma and promoting mental health, organizations can create a supportive environment that fosters healing, recovery, and productivity.

This book will explore the definition and causes of workplace trauma, as well as the impact of trauma on mental health. We will also provide strategies for addressing workplace trauma, including developing policies and procedures, providing access to mental health services, and building a culture of support and respect.

We will also explore the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment for employees who have experienced trauma. This includes offering resources for trauma recovery such as EAPs, support groups, and wellness programs.

Through this book, we hope to provide organizations with the tools they need to address workplace trauma and improve employee mental health. We believe that by doing so, organizations can create a culture of safety and respect, while also improving organizational culture and performance.
