Employee engagement is critical for the success of trauma-informed practices. Leaders must encourage employee engagement by soliciting feedback, providing opportunities for input, and demonstrating a commitment to addressing workplace trauma and promoting employee mental health.

Providing Ongoing Support

Implementing trauma-informed practices is an ongoing process that requires ongoing support. Leaders must provide ongoing support by monitoring progress, offering resources for continued education and training, and creating a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.
