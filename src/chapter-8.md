Addressing Challenges and Setbacks

Despite best efforts, there may be challenges and setbacks when addressing workplace trauma and promoting employee mental health. When these occur, leaders should:

* Listen to feedback: Leaders should listen to feedback from employees and adjust their approach as needed.
