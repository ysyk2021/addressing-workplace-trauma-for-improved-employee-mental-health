### Case Study 4: Organizational Restructuring and Job Loss

During a period of organizational restructuring, several employees faced sudden job loss, causing significant trauma and feelings of insecurity.

The organization responded by offering outplacement services, career transition support, and mental health resources to mitigate the traumatic impact and foster resilience.

### Case Study 5: Burnout and Work Overload
